# Hi! I'm Laura Pimentel! ðŸ˜¸

## About Me

I'm currently completing my Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences with a focus on Genetics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/)). </br>
My goal is to dedicate myself to the field of Computational Biology, where I can apply programming and data analysis skills to solve complex problems in biology, especially those related to genetics and bioinformatics. <br />

## What You'll Find Here

In my repositories, you'll find exercises focused on bioinformatics and programming that I'm completing during my academic journey, as well as projects I develop based on computational biology courses I take to complement my studies. Dive into these repositories to explore practical applications of computational techniques in biology, from basic exercises to more advanced projects.
